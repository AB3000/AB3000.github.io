                <p style = "font-size: 30px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;"> These are a few of my attempts at 
                game creation! I mainly work with 2D projects, but I am looking
                into 3D games as well! So far, most of the "games" I've created typically 
                focus on one aspect (i.e. dialogue, character customization, etc.) I'm currently
                working on a complete project that combines what I've currently learned :). 
                My graphics are either made in Adobe Animate or individual frames in Inkscape!
                Additionally, if you'd like to try any of the games yourself, 
                feel free to download the project and open it on Unity :). For now, hope you enjoy browsing! </p>

        <p style = "font-size: 20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;"> This is a 2D game I created just to test out the idea of character customization. 
                                        You can change her skin tone, hair color + style, and her blouse color. 
                                        The character can walk left and right. Below is a short compilation of a few
                                        styles that are available!</p>

      <!-- game 2 -->
      <br>

      <p style = "font-size: 20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;"> This is a 2D game designed to work with 
                dialogue and interact with other objects in the scene. This was just a trial 
                run of a girl trying to find where her briefcase went (still working on finishing this up :P).
                As of now, however, you can push and open various items in the game!</p>
