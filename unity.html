                <p style = "font-size: 30px;"> These are a few of my attempts at 
                game creation! I mainly work with 2D projects, but I am looking
                into 3D games as well! So far, most of the "games" I've created typically 
                focus on one aspect (i.e. dialogue, character customization, etc.) I'm currently
                working on a complete project that combines what I've currently learned :). 
                For now, hope you enjoy browsing! </p>

        <p style = "font-size: 20px;"> This is a 2D game I created just to test out the idea of character customization. 
                                        You can change her skin tone, hair color + style, and her blouse color. 
                                        The character can walk left and right. Below is a short compilation of a few
                                        styles that are available! If you'd like to try it out yourself, feel free to download 
                                        the project and open it on Unity :).</p>
